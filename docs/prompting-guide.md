# Shell Starter - PRD Generation Guide

This guide helps you create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRD) for your Shell Starter projects using AI assistance.

## üìã Quick Start: PRD Generation Prompt

Use this prompt template with any AI assistant to generate a complete requirements.md:

```
Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a [PROJECT_TYPE] CLI tool called "[PROJECT_NAME]".

## Project Context:
- **Purpose**: [What problem does this solve?]
- **Target Users**: [Who will use this tool?]

## Requirements:
Generate a PRD following this exact structure with NO checkboxes or REQ-X codes:

### Product Overview
- Clear problem statement and solution approach
- Target user identification

### User Stories  
- 3-5 user stories in "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" format

### Core Features
- 4-6 main features with clear acceptance criteria
- Focus on user-facing functionality

### CLI Interface Requirements
- Interactive mode specifications
- Direct command-line usage patterns
- Help and version requirements

### Shell Starter Compliance
- Integration with Shell Starter library functions
- Logging, error handling, and UI standards
- Argument parsing conventions

### Technical Requirements
- Dependency management
- Input/output validation
- Cross-platform compatibility
- File handling requirements

### Error Handling Scenarios
- Specific error cases and expected responses
- User guidance for common issues

### Quality & Performance Requirements
- Code quality standards (shellcheck, shfmt)
- Testing requirements
- Performance expectations

### Success Criteria
- Measurable completion indicators
- User experience standards
- Integration requirements

Format as clean markdown with bullet points only. No task codes or checkboxes.
```

## üéØ Example Usage

### Example 1: File Converter Tool
```
Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a file format conversion CLI tool called "universal-convert".

## Project Context:
- **Purpose**: Convert between common file formats (images, documents, media) with a single CLI tool
- **Target Users**: Developers, content creators, system administrators
- **Core Functionality**: Multi-format file conversion with automatic format detection and batch processing

[Continue with the template above...]
```

### Example 2: Development Utility
```
Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a development workflow CLI tool called "env-manager".

## Project Context:
- **Purpose**: Manage multiple development environments and their configurations across projects
- **Target Users**: Software developers, DevOps engineers, team leads
- **Core Functionality**: Switch between development environments, manage environment variables, and sync configurations

[Continue with the template above...]
```

## üîß Customization Guidelines

### Adapting the Template

**For Simple Tools** (single-purpose utilities):
- Reduce Core Features to 2-3 items
- Simplify CLI Interface Requirements
- Focus on one primary user type

**For Complex Tools** (multi-command systems):
- Expand Core Features to 6-8 items
- Add subcommand specifications to CLI Interface
- Include multiple user personas

**For Integration Tools** (work with external systems):
- Emphasize dependency checking in Technical Requirements
- Expand Error Handling Scenarios
- Add API/external service requirements

### Domain-Specific Additions

**For File Processing Tools**:
- Add file format specifications
- Include performance requirements for large files
- Specify backup and safety features

**For Network Tools**:
- Add connectivity requirements
- Include timeout and retry specifications
- Specify authentication methods

**For Development Tools**:
- Add IDE/editor integration requirements
- Include configuration file specifications
- Specify Git integration needs

## üìñ PRD Quality Checklist

- [ ] Covers bats testing expectations

### Technical Clarity
- [ ] Dependencies are explicitly listed
- [ ] Input/output validation is specified
- [ ] File handling requirements are clear
- [ ] Cross-platform needs are addressed
- [ ] Performance expectations are realistic

### AI Implementation Readiness
- [ ] Requirements are specific enough for AI to implement
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are unambiguous
- [ ] Technical details provide sufficient guidance
- [ ] Error handling covers edge cases
- [ ] Integration points are well-defined

## üöÄ Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Iterative Refinement
After generating an initial PRD, use these follow-up prompts:

```
Review the generated PRD and enhance the [SECTION] section with:
- More specific acceptance criteria
- Additional edge cases for error handling
- Clearer technical specifications
- Better user experience details
```

### Domain Expert Perspective
```
Review this PRD from the perspective of a [DOMAIN] expert and suggest:
- Industry-specific requirements that are missing
- Best practices that should be included
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Standards compliance requirements
```

### User Experience Focus
```
Enhance this PRD's user experience requirements by adding:
- Specific help text and usage examples
- Interactive prompt specifications
- Progress feedback requirements
- Error message formatting standards
```

## üé® Best Practices

### Writing Effective Requirements
1. **Be Specific**: "Validate email format" vs "Check input"
2. **Include Examples**: Show expected command usage patterns
3. **Define Acceptance**: What does "success" look like?
4. **Consider Edge Cases**: What could go wrong?
5. **Think User-First**: How will users actually use this?

### Shell Starter Integration
1. **Reference Examples**: Point to existing `bin/` scripts
2. **Use Conventions**: Follow established patterns
3. **Leverage Libraries**: Specify lib/main.sh functions
4. **Plan Testing**: Include bats test requirements
5. **Consider Distribution**: Plan for installer integration

### AI Implementation Success
1. **Provide Context**: Explain the "why" behind requirements
2. **Be Measurable**: Include testable criteria
3. **Show Relationships**: How features connect together
4. **Include Priorities**: What's essential vs nice-to-have
5. **Plan Phases**: How to build incrementally

**Pro Tip**: Start with the minimal template for simple tools, then expand to comprehensive format for complex projects. The AI will follow your PRD structure when implementing, so invest time in getting requirements right upfront.
