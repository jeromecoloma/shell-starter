## Phase 2: Requirements Definition (3 minutes)

### Step 4: Define Your Image Resizer Requirements

Our tool should:

- ‚úÖ **Batch process** multiple images in a directory
- ‚úÖ **Interactive prompts** for input/output paths and dimensions  
- ‚úÖ **Dependency checking** to ensure ImageMagick is available
- ‚úÖ **Progress indicators** during processing
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** for invalid files, permissions, disk space
- ‚úÖ **Flexible sizing** (width x height, or maintain aspect ratio)
- ‚úÖ **Preview mode** to show what would be processed
- ‚úÖ **Shell Starter compliance** (help, version, logging, etc.)

### Step 5: Plan the User Experience

```bash
# Desired usage patterns:
image-resize --help                    # Show comprehensive help
image-resize --version                 # Show version
image-resize                          # Interactive mode with prompts
image-resize /path/to/input /path/to/output 800x600    # Direct mode
image-resize --preview /path/to/input 1920x1080       # Preview only
```

## Phase 3: AI-Assisted Development (15 minutes)

### Step 6: Setup Autonomous AI Development Workflow

Instead of crafting a single prompt, we'll set up a self-managing AI development system that can work across context windows and different AI coding agents.

#### 6A: Generate AI Workflow Structure

```bash
# Generate the autonomous development workflow
./bin/generate-ai-workflow image-resize
```

This creates:
- `.ai-workflow/state/` - Task tracking and progress files
- `.ai-workflow/commands/` - Multi-agent command definitions

#### 6B: Customize Project Requirements

Edit the generated requirements file:

```bash
# Edit the project requirements
# Update with image-resizer specific features
open .ai-workflow/state/requirements.md
```

Update it with:

```markdown
# image-resize - Project Requirements
**Task Code**: `REQ-IMAGE-RESIZE`

```

#### 6C: Install Commands for Your AI Agent

Copy the appropriate commands to your coding agent:

```bash
# For Claude Code users:
cp -r .ai-workflow/commands/.claude/commands/ .claude/

# For Cursor users:
cp -r .ai-workflow/commands/.cursor/commands/ .cursor/

# For Gemini CLI users:
cp -r .ai-workflow/commands/.gemini/commands/ .gemini/

# For OpenCode users:
cp -r .ai-workflow/commands/.opencode/command/ .opencode/
```

### Step 7: Start Autonomous Development

Now launch the AI development cycle:

```
/dev start
```

Your AI coding agent will now:

1. **Read** the current state from `.ai-workflow/state/` files
2. **Analyze** the next incomplete task
3. **Act** by implementing that specific feature
4. **Verify** with quality checks (shellcheck, shfmt, manual testing)
5. **Update** progress in the state files
6. **Continue** to the next task automatically

**Expected AI Output:**
```
üîÑ AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT CYCLE
Current Task: IMAGE-RESIZE-1: Create project structure and basic executable
Action: Creating bin/image-resize with Shell Starter template structure
Progress: Implementing help text and argument parsing
Next: IMAGE-RESIZE-2: Implement help text and version handling
```

### Step 8: Monitor and Resume Development

If the AI reaches context limits, it will save state and prompt you:

```
Continue development with: /dev
```

Simply start a new conversation and run:

```
/dev
```

The AI will read the saved state and continue exactly where it left off.

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (10 minutes)

### Step 9: Run Quality Assurance

The AI workflow includes built-in QA. Run comprehensive checks:

```
/qa
```

**Expected QA Output:**
```
üîç QA REPORT
Files Checked: bin/image-resize
Issues Found: 0
Critical: None
Warnings: None
Status: PASS - Ready for manual testing
```

If issues are found, the AI will provide specific fixes to implement.

### Step 10: Manual Testing

The autonomous development should have created a working script. Test it:

```bash
# Test help and version (should work automatically)
./bin/image-resize --help
./bin/image-resize --version

# Test dependency checking
./bin/image-resize --preview /nonexistent/path 800x600

# The AI should have implemented proper error handling for all scenarios
```

### Step 11: Create Test Images and Directories

```bash
# Create test directory structure
mkdir -p test-images/input test-images/output

# Add some test images to test-images/input/
# (download or copy some sample images)

# Test the modes (AI should have implemented all these)
./bin/image-resize                                    # Interactive mode
./bin/image-resize test-images/input test-images/output 800x600  # Direct mode
./bin/image-resize --preview test-images/input 1920x1080        # Preview mode
```

### Step 12: Handle Issues and Iterate

If issues are found, the autonomous workflow handles fixes:

```
/dev
```

The AI will:
1. Detect the issue from testing results
2. Fix the problem automatically
3. Re-run QA to verify the fix
4. Update progress logs

For complex issues, you can check development status:

```
/status
```

## Phase 5: Enhancement & Documentation (7 minutes)

### Step 13: Add Advanced Features

To add enhancements, update the requirements and let the AI continue:

```bash
# Edit requirements to add new features
open .ai-workflow/state/requirements.md
```

Add to the requirements:
```markdown
## Advanced Features
- [ ] Quality settings: --quality option (1-100) for JPEG compression
- [ ] Format conversion: --format flag for output format (jpg/png/etc)
- [ ] Recursive processing: --recursive flag to process subdirectories
- [ ] Progress indicators: "Processing image X of Y" display
- [ ] Enhanced preview: Show before/after file sizes
```

Then continue development:
```
/dev
```

The AI will automatically pick up the new requirements and implement them following the same autonomous cycle.

### Step 14: Generate Comprehensive Tests

```
Create comprehensive Bats tests for the image-resize script.

The tests should cover:
- Help and version output validation
- Dependency checking (ImageMagick availability)
- Input validation (directories, dimension formats)
- Error conditions (invalid paths, permissions)
- Interactive mode simulation
- Direct mode with various argument combinations
- Preview mode functionality

Requirements:
- Save as tests/image-resize.bats
- Use proper Bats test structure with setup() and teardown()
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Verify exit codes and output content
- Follow the testing patterns from existing test files
```

### Step 15: Final Integration & Distribution Setup

```bash
# Run the new tests
./tests/bats-core/bin/bats tests/image-resize.bats

# Add your script to the installer manifest
# This allows users to install your CLI tool with one command
# Edit install.sh to include bin/image-resize in the SCRIPTS array

# Final quality check
shellcheck bin/image-resize tests/image-resize.bats
shfmt -d bin/image-resize
```

### Step 16: Prepare for Distribution

Now that your tool is complete, you can distribute it like any professional CLI:

```bash
# 1. Update VERSION file for your first release
echo "1.0.0" > VERSION

# 2. Update README.md with your tool's description
# Replace Shell Starter content with your Image Resizer documentation

# 3. Push to your own GitHub repository
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/image-resize-cli.git
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add image-resize CLI tool with batch processing"
git push -u origin main

# 4. Your users can now install with:
# curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/image-resize-cli/main/install.sh | bash
```
